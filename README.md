# iGuide

## Background 
For the visually impaired, mobility, the ability to maneuver in an environment of various obstructions, stairs, and other static entities, is an issue faced every day, when trying to get around places. Self-navigation in unfamiliar environments is extremely difficult due to unknown terrains and possible hazards. This is not limited to outdoor exploration, but indoors as well.

Research revealed that the frequency of the visually impaired travelling outside of familiar routes in a week was above 40%, and the frequency of having head-level accidents and trip-falls annually was above 40%, which is an alarming figure. [1] 

A study showed that they faced many challenges in not only their daily physical security and privacy, but also safety. Outside of home, due to their inability to recognize unsafe situations and surroundings, they developed a sense of helplessness of being unable to determine their safety of their environment. As such, they had no choice but to avoid such situations as a whole. [2]

While mobility aids such as canes and guide dogs have been useful in supporting the visually impaired, they are still insufficient in the context of exploring new or unfamiliar environments and confined spaces, where it gets confusingly tough to get from place to place, as safety is a concern.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop an Android application that helps to relieve the visually impaired of the mentioned problems. The scope of this project will be limited to the hallway of Staff Offices’ at SCSE Level 2, Block C. The application, to be named iGuide, uses Bluetooth Low-Energy Beacons to empower real-time unsighted navigation indoors. These beacons will be placed at areas of importance, such as professors’ rooms and doorways, as well as any possible hazardous locations, such as renovation sites or uneven ground. These Bluetooth Beacons will be able to cover a range as wide as up to 200m, allowing for seamless offline indoor navigation.

When the user is within proximity of the beacons’ Bluetooth range, iGuide interacts with the beacons and alerts the user of available destinations. Through precise directional indicators, a safe route of travel to the user-specified destination that bypasses possible hazards will be provided, improving mobility. Pertinent information regarding the environment will be given through voice alerts voluntarily, so that the user can be aware of hazards such as slopes, uneven terrain, or other dangers during travel. This makes exploration of places safe and convenient.

As such, the rate of injuries can be reduced and the ongoing concerns by the visually impaired of possible injuries while exploring unfamiliar environments can be eliminated. This allows them to explore places that they have never been to before.
